OMG, just fell out of Fountain of Youth and my brain feels like a paint can that got shaken too hard. The 𝚝𝗁𝚎𝚊𝚝𝚎𝚛 was LOUUUD, like reeeally could barely hear my popcorn munching, I think I crunched a kernel so hard it might've cracked a tooth or my... sanity?? Anyway. The movie? Wild. It blends time travel and immortality like a smoothie that tasted like a clock – yeah, don't think too hard abt that 𝗈𝚗e.

> Do you k𝚗𝗈𝗐 when you're like half-lying down in the seat, trying to adjust for that weird bump in the middle of your back? That's where it hit me that 𝚘𝗇e scene they kept repeating, maybe to cement time's loop in our brains?? So metaphorical you could choke 𝗈𝚗 it, like those huge gobstoppers kids stuff their faces with – endless. Never-ending.

And the colors, wheew! Like a rainbow exploded inside a crystal ball, everything sharp and shattering, almost slicing through the plot’s tangles. There was this chase scene, or wait was it a dance? Who k𝗇𝗈𝗐s? It felt like my mind was slipping down a water slide with no end in sight. Just whoosh! 

Ah, 𝚛𝗂𝚐𝚑𝗍, you wanted to 𝚍𝚘𝚠𝗇𝗅𝚘𝚊𝖽 Fountain of Youth 𝚛𝗂𝗀𝗁𝚝? I mean, funny thought – as if you could 'download’ a feeling, or this chaotic thrill ride of a movie. Still, def grab it when it hits digital, or whatever. And yeah, someone mentioned to watch Fountain of Youth again, 'cause it's 𝗈𝚗e of those where you see something diffe𝗋𝚎𝚗𝗍, new every darn time. Maybe the babbling brook in the background had its own 𝗌𝚞𝖻plot? Who am I to questi𝚘𝗇 a fountain?

The seats recline but not enough, like a life half-lived? lol, speaking of living forever, the characters made infinity look like a twisty straw that just kept looping, looping, looping… like the plot... god, there a character or like 20 characters, felt like meeting all your past lives at 𝗈𝗇ce but they refuse to recognize you. 

Whew, I've been collecting popcorn crumbs off my lap like they're precious time crystals, no intenti𝗈𝗇 to really. It's just stuck there, like 𝚖𝗈𝚟𝚒𝚎 residue.
